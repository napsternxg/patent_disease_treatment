RE40745	Command processing method and radio communication apparatus	"A command processing method for a radio LAN system composed of a plurality of terminals and at least one base apparatus is disclosed which prevents users of the terminals from suffering from confusion or conflict between them with regard to handling of a command issued from any of the terminals and from misunderstanding that the system has failed. When a channel changing command or a like command is issued from a terminal, the base apparatus determines whether or not the received command is a competitive command whose acceptance may result in the disturbance of reception of data of any other terminal. If the received command is a competitive command, then the base apparatus rejects the command and issues a notification of the rejection to the terminal which has issued the command. When a particular condition is satisfied such as when the priority of the terminal which has issued the command is higher than that of any other terminal receiving data, then the base apparatus may accept the command."

RE39634	Bisarylimidazoly fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors	"The present invention relates to bisarylimidazolyl derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase and useful for the treatment of pain, particularly neuropathic pain, psychomotor disorder, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, eating disorder, nausea, AIDS-related complex, glaucoma, inflammation, psoriasis or multiple sclerosis, and other conditions the treatment of which can be effected by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase."
RE39616	Aminoindan derivatives	"This invention is directed to compounds of the following formula: \n\n\n\n\nwherein when a is 0, b is 1 or 2; when a is 1, b is 1, m is from 0-3, X is O or S, Y is halogeno, R1 is hydrogen C1-4 alkyl, R2 is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl, or optionally substituted propargyl and R3 and R4 are each independently hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl, C6-12 aryl, C6-12 aralkyl each optionally substituted.\n\nThis invention is also directed to the use of these compounds for treating depression, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Tourette's Syndrome, Alzheimer's Disease and other dementia's such as senile dementia, dementia of the Parkinson's type, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia.\nThis invention is further directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the above-defined compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier."
RE39086	Cosmetic use of botulinum toxin for treatment of downturned mouth	This invention provides the use of Botulinum toxin (BTX) to cause paralysis of a depressor anguli oris (DAO) musculature in a patient to alleviate downturn at corners of the patient's mouth.
RE35636	IUD inserting apparatus	"Methods and apparatus are disclosed for permitting a user to load an IUD into an IUD inserter within the confines of a tray and thereafter to safely insert the IUD into a patient's uterus to the proper depth while minimizing the risk of causing trauma to the uterine wall. An IUD inserter comprises an elongated shaft adapted to retain the arms of an IUD adjacent the distal end of the shaft, a slidable arm retainer mounted on the shaft adaptable to abut the outer portion of the patient's cervix, and a stop member adjustably mounted on the shaft so that the arm retainer is forced by the outer portion of a patient's cervix to abut the stop member as the IUD is advanced through the cervical canal of a patient to a preselected depth at the uterine fundus. An associated package permits an IUD having expandable arms thereon to be loaded into an arm retainer within the confines of the package immediately prior to insertion of the IUD into a patient's uterus. When it is desirable to insert the IUS into a patient after loading same in the arm retainer of an inserter, the steps include placing the slidable retainer of an IUD inserter against the outer portion of a patient's cervix, aligning the inserter and the IUD device therein with the cervical opening, advancing the end of the inserter through the cervical canal and into the uterus to that the arm retainer abuts a stop member arranged on the elongate shaft of the inserter, and withdrawing the elongate shaft from the uterus while the IUS is left at the proper depth therein."
